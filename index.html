          <p class="tagline">A realm‑wanderer, a world tree, and two emerging Eikons.</p>
          <div class="meta">Author: Utorment • Genre: Dark Speculative Fantasy • Year: 2026</div>

          <h3>Logline</h3>
          <p>
            Aldr, a battle‑hardened realm‑wanderer, must gather strength, allies, and forged weapons
            to face a mounting invasion tied to a divine world tree — and confront two godlike Eikons
            that threaten to remake the world.
          </p>

          <h3>Characters</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aldr</strong> — grizzled survivor and wanderer, bearer of a black dagger and the
              newly granted Craftsman attribute and Forge skill.</li>
            <li><strong>Stone Monkey</strong> — enigmatic fighter who bends wind/mystic arts; fast and
              unpredictable.</li>
            <li><strong>Hunter</strong> — stoic, scarred ally with uncanny resilience; practical and blunt.</li>
            <li><strong>Heila</strong> — priestess/saint tied to the world tree; orchestrates aid from above.</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- core themes and excerpt removed -->

          </p>
          <h3>Chapters</h3>
          <div class="chapters-list">
            <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
            <p>Aldr awakens in a white void and meets a spectral guide who warns him that two Eikons have appeared; he is tasked to help his old partner face godlike foes.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 2</h4>
            <p>Aldr is plunged into a temple cavern, unarmed, where he discovers a gleaming black dagger and is set upon by a limping, rotted wolf.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 3</h4>
            <p>After killing the beast Aldr reads runic sparks that reveal his title as 'Firstchosen' and basic item info for his relic dagger, learning he has no attributes yet.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 4</h4>
            <p>Aldr climbs treacherous stepping stones up a foggy mountain, struggling with his weakened body and sensing a watching presence connected to a divine tree.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 5</h4>
            <p>Exhausted and cold, Aldr presses onward; the mist shifts ominously as he nears the summit and the mountain's strange features hint at danger below.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 6</h4>
            <p>Reaching the peak Aldr is carried by a giant raven and meets a relaxed, skilled stranger (Stone Monkey) who will become an unpredictable companion.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 7</h4>
            <p>Stone Monkey and Aldr trade banter; Stone Monkey demonstrates mystic combat abilities and teases Aldr about names and forgotten pasts.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 8</h4>
            <p>The pair spar and Aldr recognizes Stone Monkey's mystic art — an ability to bend wind and the environment to technique — while the darker pull from the fog grows stronger.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 9</h4>
            <p>Aldr and Stone Monkey observe an eerie hum from beyond the horizon; Aldr experiences the ringing in his head and the world's manipulative influence intensifies.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 10</h4>
            <p>The world tree grants Aldr the 'Craftsman' attribute and the 'Forge' skill; he tests the ability by forming a basic bone blade from gathered material.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 11</h4>
            <p>Aldr notices the raven's green blood and a trail leading to a deep, bottomless pit; Heila, a saintess connected to the tree, also senses movement toward the mountains.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 12</h4>
            <p>Falling into a dark den Aldr struggles with mind‑affecting rings and calibrates his will, producing bursts of red spark that push back the surrounding darkness.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 13</h4>
            <p>Aldr reaches a bone‑littered lair and meets a fierce survivor called Hunter; using his Forge skill he shapes bones into a usable Bone Sword despite limited will.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 14</h4>
            <p>Aldr's Bone Sword is completed but initially lacks attributes; he exchanges equipment with Hunter and learns more about the world's abandonment of death and the perilous nature of its inhabitants.</p>
